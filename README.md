# Fall 2019 Game Design ‚Äî Assignment 2 (Reading and background rendering)

* **Do not edit this file.**  
* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**

## Introduction
This assignment is broken down into two parts: 1) answering questions from the readings, and 2) generating two environment backgrounds, including obstacles, in which the creature from your first assignment lives.

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## Programming
* Using Processing, open the `sketch` folder in this repo. Do all your work in this sketch and do not rename the folder or its containing `.pde` file.
* Create a canvas that is `1280 √ó 800`.
* Add your creature from assignment 1, complete with keyboard bindings.
* Render a background in the canvas using **only** Processing‚Äôs primitives (no images).
* Design 5 different obstacles to the background discussed in the previous step using **only** images (no primitives). **You must have the right to use those images,** and they must have a `.png` or a `.jpg` extension. Place them in the included `img` folder.
* Render a second background in the canvas using one or more images (no primitives). **You must have the right to use those images,** and they too must have a `.png` or a `.jpg` extension. Place them in the included `img` folder.
* Using **only** Processing‚Äôs primitives (no images), design 5 different obstacles to be included in the background from the previous step.
* Creatures and obstacles must employ collision detection.
* Pressing the letter ‚ÄùF‚Äù on the keyboard enables the first background and disables the second.
* Pressing the letter ‚ÄùS‚Äù on the keyboard enables the second background and disables the first.

## Questions from Readings
For the following five questions, include your answers between the set of backticks under each question.

1. What is a game?
```
A game is a form of entertainment where you are presented with a way to ‚Äúwin‚Äù and ‚Äúlose.‚Äù Some games abstract winning and losing to be objectives. Ghis is what the book defines as a game is that it is a set of rules and objectives.
```
2. Should game objectives be simple or elaborate?

```
3. In the early 1980s, how many machine type dominated the gaming market? Describe them.
```
There were 3 kinds of gaming machines. There were uprights, cocktails and cockpits. Uprights were arcade machines you stood at, cocktails were arcade machines you sat at and cockpits were the ones you ‚Äúrode‚Äù in. You sat in a seat and looked up at a screen. 
```
4. In the development of a major video game, the roles include programmer, artist, designer, producer, tester, composer, sound designer, and writer. Define the roles of the designer and the programmer.

The designer is the person who ‚Äúthinks‚Äù about what the game will look like. They do things like design the levels and the environments that the player is put in.
```

```
