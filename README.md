# Fall 2019 Game Design ‚Äî Assignment 2 (Reading and background rendering)

* **Do not edit this file.**  
* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**

## Introduction
This assignment is broken down into two parts: 1) answering questions from the readings, and 2) generating two environment backgrounds, including obstacles, in which the creature from your first assignment lives.

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## Programming
* Using Processing, open the `sketch` folder in this repo. Do all your work in this sketch and do not rename the folder or its containing `.pde` file.
* Create a canvas that is `1280 √ó 800`.
* Add your creature from assignment 1, complete with keyboard bindings.
* Render a background in the canvas using **only** Processing‚Äôs primitives (no images).
* Design 5 different obstacles to the background discussed in the previous step using **only** images (no primitives). **You must have the right to use those images,** and they must have a `.png` or a `.jpg` extension. Place them in the included `img` folder.
* Render a second background in the canvas using one or more images (no primitives). **You must have the right to use those images,** and they too must have a `.png` or a `.jpg` extension. Place them in the included `img` folder.
* Using **only** Processing‚Äôs primitives (no images), design 5 different obstacles to be included in the background from the previous step.
* Creatures and obstacles must employ collision detection.
* Pressing the letter ‚ÄùF‚Äù on the keyboard enables the first background and disables the second.
* Pressing the letter ‚ÄùS‚Äù on the keyboard enables the second background and disables the first.
