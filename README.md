# Fall 2019 Game Design ‚Äî Assignment 2 (Reading and background rendering)

* **Do not edit this file.**  
* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**

## Introduction
This assignment is broken down into two parts: 1) answering questions from the readings, and 2) generating two environment backgrounds, including obstacles, in which the creature from your first assignment lives.

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## Programming
* Using Processing, open the `sketch` folder in this repo. Do all your work in this sketch and do not rename the folder or its containing `.pde` file.
* Create a canvas that is `1280 √ó 800`.
* Add your creature from assignment 1, complete with keyboard bindings.
* Render a background in the canvas using **only** Processing‚Äôs primitives (no images).
* Design 5 different obstacles to the background discussed in the previous step using **only** images (no primitives). **You must have the right to use those images,** and they must have a `.png` or a `.jpg` extension. Place them in the included `img` folder.
* Render a second background in the canvas using one or more images (no primitives). **You must have the right to use those images,** and they too must have a `.png` or a `.jpg` extension. Place them in the included `img` folder.
* Using **only** Processing‚Äôs primitives (no images), design 5 different obstacles to be included in the background from the previous step.
* Creatures and obstacles must employ collision detection.
* Pressing the letter ‚ÄùF‚Äù on the keyboard enables the first background and disables the second.
* Pressing the letter ‚ÄùS‚Äù on the keyboard enables the second background and disables the first.

## Questions from Readings
For the following five questions, include your answers between the set of backticks under each question.

1. What is a game?
```
A game is an activity that requires at least one player, has rules, and has a win and/or lose condition.
```
2. Should game objectives be simple or elaborate?
```
A games objective should be simple so that the players know the goal. The objective should be clear and can be summarized quickly.
```
3. In the early 1980s, how many machine type dominated the gaming market? Describe them.
```
In the 1980s, three machine types dominated the gaming market. The first one was Uprights. A player would stand upright in front of this cabinet while playing. The second one was Cocktail Tables. This is an arcade game that was set up on top of a table so the player can sit down while using it. The third machine was Cockpits. This was a game cabinet where players could lean or sit down to help enhance the gaming experience as if you‚Äôre actually inside the video game.
```
4. In the development of a major video game, the roles include programmer, artist, designer, producer, tester, composer, sound designer, and writer. Define the roles of the designer and the programmer.
```
The programmer uses different programming languages to write code that helps the games functions in multiple ways. They code to draw graphics, the control systems for users, camera functions that give players visuals, writes the AI system and so much more. Every programmer usually completes different tasks and roles depending on the objective.

 A designer, specifically a game designer, should have great communication skills as well as being well rounded in plenty of other skills. Designers tend to have specific specializations such as being a level designer, combat designer, system designer, or creative director. Designers main objective is to tell the difference between a good or bad game and to make sure that the game is fun for its intended audience.

```
5. Which role is a great gateway job into the gaming industry?
```
Being a tester is a great gateway job to get into the gaming industry. Although this is a tedious and boring job, testers are essential to the game running smoothly and it‚Äôs a great way to work your way up in the industry. 
```
